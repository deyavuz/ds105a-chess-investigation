        <h4 class="mb-3">Competitive Success vs. Public Attention in Chess</h4>
        <p>
          Looking at Yi Wei's graph along with those of other top ten players reveals an interesting disconnect between 
          competitive success and public attention in chess. While these players demonstrate remarkable consistency in 
          their FIDE ratings - often maintaining extremely high levels of performance for years - their search popularity 
          tends to follow much more erratic patterns that don't necessarily align with their competitive achievements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The normalized FIDE ratings for elite players like Yi Wei typically show steady upward trajectories followed by 
          sustained high performance, reflecting their mastery of the game. However, the search volume patterns across all 
          these top players demonstrate that public interest operates independently of playing strength. The sporadic spikes 
          in search volume, like those seen for Yi Wei in late 2024 and early 2025, appear to be common across the cohort of 
          elite players, suggesting that chess success alone doesn't drive public attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          This pattern raises interesting questions about what actually captures public interest in chess. Despite these 
          players being among the world's best, their moments of peak public attention don't necessarily coincide with their 
          greatest competitive achievements. Instead, search interest seems to be driven by other factors - perhaps specific 
          matches, tournaments, or events that temporarily capture public imagination, even if they aren't necessarily the 
          most significant moments in terms of pure chess accomplishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that this pattern repeats across the top ten players suggests a broader truth about chess as a sport: 
          technical excellence and public engagement operate on different wavelengths, with success at the board not 
          automatically translating into broader public recognition or interest.

        <p>
          Alireza Firouzja's FIDE rating progression from 2014 to 2025 showcases a pattern that appears consistently across many top chess players' careers, though his rise is particularly dramatic. Starting from around 1800 in 2014, his ratings across all three formats (standard, rapid, and blitz) show a remarkably steep ascent until reaching approximately 2800, where they begin to plateau around 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          This plateau effect near 2800 is particularly interesting because it's a phenomenon seen across many top players' rating graphs. Even with different starting points and rates of progression, there seems to be a natural "ceiling" where progress becomes incrementally smaller. This could be interpreted as approaching the theoretical limits of human chess performance, or perhaps reflecting the increasing difficulty of gaining rating points at higher levels due to the mathematical nature of the Elo rating system.
        </p>
        <p>
          What sets Firouzja's graph apart is the compressed timeframe of his ascent - achieving in roughly 8 years what traditionally took players 15-20 years. His blitz rating (green line) consistently leads the other formats during his rise, which might suggest that younger players are particularly adept at faster time controls, possibly due to growing up in an era where online blitz chess is commonplace. However, by the plateau phase, all three ratings converge around similar levels, indicating mastery across all time controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The universal pattern of rapid rise followed by plateau that we see across top players' graphs raises interesting questions about chess development. It suggests that while modern training methods and resources might accelerate the journey to elite level, they haven't necessarily raised the ceiling of peak human performance in chess. This pattern might represent a fundamental limit in human chess capability, regardless of the speed of initial development.
