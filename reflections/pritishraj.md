Technical Contributions:
My primary focus for this project was data visualization and the website. However, due to the fluid nature of our group, I was also heavily involved in data collection. One major challenge I encountered was maintaining the interactive qualities of our graphs. Initially, exporting them as PNGs was the simplest approach, but this removed interactivity. I found it fascinating to learn how to export our graphs as HTML files to retain their interactive elements.

Additionally, I contributed to creating the base function for our comparative graphing of two data time series while also working on retrieving data from our database. When it came to technical decisions, I played a key role in improving our code efficiency, whether by introducing new libraries or recognizing the need for an external function file to avoid redundant code.

Team Collaboration:
Our team collaboration was a positive and smooth experience. We were almost always on the same page, making decision-making efficient and effective. Everyone maintained a strong sense of responsibility, which made the project feel like a tag-team effortâ€”while each person had a designated role, we were always ready to assist if someone encountered difficulties or was unavailable.

We prioritized frequent feedback and responsiveness throughout the project, ensuring everyone was well-informed about progress and setbacks. This open communication made our workflow smooth and conflict-free.

Learning Journey:
One of my biggest takeaways from this project was learning to collaborate effectively within a team, especially using GitHub. Initially, we faced challenges with commit conflicts and unexpected issues, such as Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) converting into raw JSON. This experience highlighted the importance of improving my understanding of GitHub branching, pushing, and pulling to avoid these issues in future projects.

I also improved my data-handling efficiency. Instead of retrieving entire JSON files before filtering, I learned to filter data on-call and save only the necessary parts directly to a CSV or database. We implemented this approach for Chess.com and FIDE data, reducing unnecessary excess files.

From the statistical analysis we conducted, I also realized that I need to deepen my knowledge of data analysis techniques. Moving forward, I aim to improve my ability to interpret and analyze data more effectively, ensuring our visualizations and insights are as meaningful as possible.
