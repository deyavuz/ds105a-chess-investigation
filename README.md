![Chess.com](data/image/chessboard.png)

**Authors:** 
- Pritish Raj 
- Defne Ece Yavuz
- Coleman Cochran 


This project analyzes the performance trends of the top ten chess players using data from Chess.com, Google Trends, and FIDE. It includes **data collection**, **processing**, and **visualization** to answer critical questions about player performance and influence.

## **Research Questions**
- **How do the top ten chess players vary in performance across different game modes?**  
- **Does player performance online align with their FIDE rating progression over time?**  
- **How does their success correlate with chess interest in their home country? Are certain players more influential than others?**

---

## **Justification of Data Sources**
- **[Chess.com API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api)**: Provides player profiles, game statistics (blitz, rapid, standard ratings), and tournament performances.  
- **[SERPAPI (Google Trends)](https://serpapi.com/dashboard)**: Supplies keyword popularity time series data, focusing on public interest in chess players and chess-related terms via Google Trends.  
- **[FIDE Web Scraper](https://github.com/xRuiAlves/fide-ratings-scraper/tree/master#api-documentation)**: Offers historical ELO ratings to track long-term player performance trends.

---

## **Technical Implementation Plan**
1. **Gain Authentication for APIs**:  
   - Obtain OAuth access for Chess.com and SERPAPI.  
   - Set up FIDE web scraper for historical data extraction.  

2. **Extract Data**:  
   - Retrieve player profiles, including blitz, rapid, standard, and FIDE ratings, from Chess.com.  
   - Use SERPAPI to gather Google Trends data for players and "chess" in their home countries.  
   - Scrape historical FIDE rankings to track rating progression over time.

3. **Data Integration**:  
   - Store all datasets in a SQLite database for analysis.  

4. **Analyze and Visualize Data**:  
   - Compare player performance across game modes.  
   - Correlate public search interest with player ratings. 
   - Create graphs and visualizations to present findings.

---

## **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
- **Avoiding API Rate-Limit Errors**:  
  - All team members have API access to distribute load.  
  - Implement request throttling to prevent 429 errors.  

- **Backup Plans**:  
  - **Lichess API**: Alternative source for player profiles and game statistics.  
  - **Financial Analysis Alternative**: Use Reddit and Google Trends APIs to explore correlations between trending financial topics and public interest.

---

## **Future Extensions**
- Investigate the impact of Twitch streaming (e.g., Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura) on player ratings using the Twitch API.  
- Study correlations between streaming hours and performance metrics.

---

## **Work Distribution Strategy**
- **Phase 1: Data Collection** â€“ Divide API setup and data retrieval tasks.  
- **Phase 2: Data Analysis** â€“ Assign statistical tests and trend correlation tasks based on expertise.  
- **Phase 3: Data Visualization** â€“ Share responsibility for creating visualizations and graphs.


## **Intended Progression**

RQ2: 

---

Data Sources:
- **[Chess.com API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api)**: Provides player profiles, game statistics (blitz, rapid, daily ratings), and tournament performances.  
- **[SERPAPI (Google Trends)](https://serpapi.com/dashboard)**: Supplies keyword popularity time series data, focusing on public interest in chess players and chess-related terms via Google Trends.  
- **[FIDE Web Scraper](https://github.com/xRuiAlves/fide-ratings-scraper/tree/master#api-documentation)**: Offers historical ELO ratings to track long-term player performance trends.

Methodology:
1) Define a dataframe of the current, active, global top 10 chess players
2) Configure and use the FIDE Ratings Scraper to collect the classic, rapid, and blitz over-the-board data of the 10 players, convert it into a pandas dataframe
3) 
4) 
5)

How to recreate the Python environment
1) Install pyenv through running brew install pyenv (for Mac) or curl https://pyenv.run | bash (for Linux)
2) Install the required Python version by running pyenv install 3.12.2 and then pyenv local 3.12.2
3) To create and activate the virtual environment, run python -m venv venv and then source venv/bin/activate (for Mac/Linux) and .\venv\Scripts\activate (for Windows)
4) Run pip install -r requirements.txt, where requirements.txt is a document containing all the required libraries (e.g., pandas) and the versions to be used
